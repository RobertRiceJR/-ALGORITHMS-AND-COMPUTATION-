**Author:** Robert Rice • **Date:** 9/6/2025 

## 1. Objective
<What question are you answering or metric you are validating?>

## 2. Background (Optional, ≤3 bullets)
- <Key definition/theorem/expected behavior>
- <Prior result or rubric criterion to satisfy>

## 3. Materials & Environment
- Hardware/OS: <e.g., Win10, 16 GB RAM>
- Software: <e.g., Python 3.11, Node 20, gcc 13>
- Repo/Commit: <URL / short SHA>
- Data: <path/version/checksum if applicable>

## 4. Method
- Design: <brief test/algorithm description>
- Variables: <what you varied/controlled>
- Procedure: <numbered repro steps (3–7 lines)>

## 5. Results
- Table/Figure: <placeholder or “see Appendix A”>
- Primary metrics: <metric=value, units>
- Validation: <tests passed/failed>

## 6. Analysis
- Compare to expected: <agree/diverge + reason>
- Error sources/assumptions: <brief>
- Complexity/Performance (CS labs): <O(..) or timing>

## 7. Conclusions
<1–3 bullet takeaways; did you meet the objective?>

## 8. Issues, Risks, and Mitigations
- <Issue → impact → mitigation/next step>

## 9. References
<Short list of sources with consistent style>
